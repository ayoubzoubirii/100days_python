# Instructions
# You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.

# e.g. student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]

# The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.

# e.g.

# 180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = 1146

# There are a total of 7 heights in student_heights

# 1146 √∑ 7 = 163.71428571428572

# Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = 164

# Important You should not use the sum() or len() functions in your answer. You should try to replicate their functionality using what you have learnt about for loops.

# Example Input 1
# 156 178 165 171 187
# In this case, student_heights would be a list that looks like: [156, 178, 165, 171, 187]

# Example Output 1
# total height = 857
# number of students = 5
# average height = 171
# Example Input 2
# 151 145 179
# Example Output 2
# total height = 475
# number of students = 3
# average height = 158



# Input a Python list of student heights
student_heights = input().split()
for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
  student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])

# üö® Don't change the code above üëÜ

# Write your code below this row üëá
total = 0
same = 0
for student_height in student_heights :
  total += 1

for student_height in student_heights :
  same += student_height
  
average = round( same / total) 

print(f"total height = {same}")
print(f"number of students = {total}")
print(f"average height = {average}")


# Instructions
# You are going to write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.

# e.g. student_scores = [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]

# Important you are not allowed to use the max or min functions. The output words must match the example. i.e

# The highest score in the class is: x
# Example Input
# 78 65 89 86 55 91 64 89
# In this case, student_scores would be a list that looks like: [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]

# Example Output
# The highest score in the class is: 91
# Input a list of student scores
student_scores = input().split()
for n in range(0, len(student_scores)):
  student_scores[n] = int(student_scores[n])
top_score = 0
# Write your code below this row üëá
for student_score in student_scores :
  if student_score >= top_score :
    top_score = student_score
print(f"The highest score in the class is: {top_score}")    



# Instructions
# You are going to write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to X. If X is 100 then the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100:

# i.e. 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 +10 ... + 98 + 100

# Important, there should only be 1 print statement in your console output. It should just print the final total and not every step of the calculation.

# Also, we will constrain the inputs to only take numbers from 0 to a max of 1000.

# Example Input 1
# 10
# Example Output 1
# 30
# Example Input 2
# 52
# Example Output 2
# 702
# Hint
# There are quite a few ways of solving this problem, but you will need to use the range() function in any of the solutions.

target = int(input()) # Enter a number between 0 and 1000
# üö® Do not change the code above ‚òùÔ∏è

# Write your code here üëá
total = 0
for n in range(0,target+1,2) :
  total += n
print(total)
